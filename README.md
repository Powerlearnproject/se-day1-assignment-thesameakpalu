Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

**Answer:** Software engineering is the aspect of technology that deals with the design,implentation and maintenance of software solutions to solve problems. For the tech industry for instance, it is important because it fuels the creation of software applications and systems that enhance technology through communication, entertainment etc.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

**Answer:** 1,Development of programming languages.
        2, Establishment of software engineering as a field.
        3, The introduction of some methodologies like Agile.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

**Answer:** Requirements: Stage of considering the features that will be neccessary in solving the problem of the users and some requirements the system may need.

Design: Visualizing the user interface and the architecture of the software. this can be done with drawings or using tools like figma

Implementation: putting in efforts into creating the end product(that is the software) based on design specifications.

Testing: Conducting various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements.

Deployment: Making the software available to be used by end users or say clients or perhaps customers.

Maintenance: Enhancing the software after it has been released


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

| Waterfall    | Agile Methodology |
|------------------|--------------------|
|This is a linear ethod which also has fixed phases | An agile method is an iterative, flexible and adaptive process|
| An example of a scenario that uses this method is building a financial system where security is paramount and small changes must be evaluated. | An example of a scenario is building an e-commerece website|


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

|Role  | Software Developer | Quality Assurance Engineer | Project Manager|
|--------|---------------|--------|-------------|
|**Description**| Code Writing and software implementation| Conducts various tests to be sure the software meets quality standards|Oversees the planning, execution, and delivery of software projects|

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

**Answer:** **Integrated Development Enrionments** are sort of software suites that have tools that can be used to write, debug or test code, an example is Visual Studio Code while **Version Control Systems** are tools that enhance collaboration among teams and can also be used to track changes to source codes. an example is Git.
 
What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

| Challenges | Strategies to Overcome the challenge |
|------------|--------------------------------------|
|Changing Requirements | Using methods like Agile which is freindly to chnage of requirements during development stages.|
|Tight Deadlines | Communicating with clients to set flexible deadlines |


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

**Answer:**

 - Unit Testing: Testing individual components of the  software.
  - Integration Testing: Testing how well the different components interact with themselves.
  - System Testing: Testing the entire software system as a whole.
  - Acceptance Testing: Testing the software to ensure it meets all  user requirements.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

**Answer :** Prompt engineering refeers to the drafting of questions in a way that achieves more relevant, accurate and useful responses from AI models. A major importance is that it enhances and optimizes AI performance. 

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

**Answer :** 

**Vague Prompt:** Help me write a story.

**Improved Prompt:** Help me write a story, the story should be about 40 -50 sentences long. it should be about love with a love lesson sentenced on the statement "Love can hurt sometimes but it's worth staying strong".

**Reason why improved prompt is more effective :** With respect to the vague prompt, you can tell that the AI will generate any story of it choice based on any topic and any how it wants it long, but perhaps the user has a particular field of interest he or she wants the story to be about, whether jokes, romance etc. it was not specified, unlike the improved prompt.
